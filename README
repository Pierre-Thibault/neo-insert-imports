NAME
       insert_imports - add the necessary dead code for web2py controllers and
       models to avoid warnings and errors from the Eclipse Pydev static code
       analyzer.

SYNOPSIS
       insert_imports [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION

This script is made for people using the web2py framework with Eclipse and 
Pydev. It inserts the dead code necessary to avoid the warnings and errors
reported by Pydev due to the missing web2py imports. Web2py does automatically
insert a set of common imports for models and controllers so the user does not
have to explicitly import them in the code. This cause a problem with Pydev
since from a Pythonic point of view, these imports are missing and the static
code analyzer reports the issue as warnings or errors. This script was made to
automate the process of adding the necessary dead code to suppress these
warnings and errors.

The script is made to be used as a tool to be added in your PATH. Just call the
tool with the files to process as arguments. It will add the code just before
the Python code or at the end of the file unless the mark "STATIC_IMPORT_MARK"
(with or without quotes) is present in the file.

OPTION
    -h,  --help          Display this help message.

TIPS:

Use the power of the shell. For example if you are located in the applications
directory of web2py, you can use:

    insert_imports */controllers/*.py
    insert_imports */models/*.py
    
to process all the controllers and all the models for all applications.
